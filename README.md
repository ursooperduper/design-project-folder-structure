# Design Project Folder Structure

Just a simple bash script to set up the directory structure used in my design projects.

All project folders are placed into my Google Drive dir:
```~/Google\ Drive/Design/Projects```

## Folder Structure

The folders and their structure are based on the creative assets I work on for any given project. For the most part, written documents, briefs, etc. live outside this directory in Confluence.

The folder structure looks like this:  

```
- Project-Name
-- Archive
-- Copy
-- Developer Assets
-- Flow Diagrams
-- Prototypes
-- Research
-- Resources
-- Visual Design
-- Wireframes
-- README.md
```

## Limitations

* At present, you can only specify one project as an argument. When I get a chance, I'll make it so you can specify any number of project folders as arguments.

* The location of the main project directory is hardcoded. (```cd ~/Google\ Drive/Design/Projects```)

* The folders are all hardcoded. Just change them in the script if you want something different, edit away!
